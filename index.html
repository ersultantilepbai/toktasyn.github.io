<body>
<h2 align="center">There are 3 main laws of Newton:<br>
<h3 align="center">First law of Newton<br>
<h4 align="left">Newton’s first law of motion states that Putting Newton’s 1stlaw of motion in simple words, a body will not start moving until and unless an external force acts on it.<br>
<h3 align="center" style="color:red">F=0-V=const


<h3 align="center">Second law of Newton<br>
<h4 align="left">Newton’s second law states that the acceleration of an object depends upon two variables – the net force acting on the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of the body is directly proportional to the net force acting on the body and inversely proportional to the mass of the body.<br>
<h3 align="center" style="color:red">a=F/m

<h3 align="center">Third law of Newton<br>
<h4 align="left">Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. What this means is that pushing on an object causes that object to push back against you, the exact same amount, but in the opposite direction.
<h3 align="center" style="color:red">F=-F
