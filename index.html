  </header>
<section>
 <h2>First Law: Law of Inertia</h2>
        <p>Objects at rest stay at rest, and objects in motion stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.</p>
  </section>
 <section>
        <h2>Second Law: Force and Acceleration</h2>
 <p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon the object and inversely proportional to the object's mass.</p>
         </section>
 <section>
 <h2>Third Law: Action and Reaction</h2>
 <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
